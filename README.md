# QA Automation Suite ðŸš€

This repository showcases my hands-on experience with full-stack QA practices, including manual testing, API testing, UI automation, mobile testing, and CI/CD integration â€” all mapped to real-world testing scenarios.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Manual Testing

- Created detailed test scenarios for an e-commerce application.
- Covered features like login, add-to-cart, checkout, and payment flow.
- Test cases are written with clear steps, expected results, and severity.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. API Testing (Postman + REST Assured)

- **Postman:** Collection tests for login, user profile, and order APIs.
- **REST Assured (Java):** Automated API tests with assertions for response codes, body, and schema validation.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. UI Automation (Selenium + TestNG)

- Built using Java, Maven, and Page Object Model.
- Test cases for login, registration, and product search pages.
- Integrated with Jenkins for CI/CD.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Mobile App Testing (Appium)

- Wrote test cases for Android login and cart functionalities using Appium.
- Capable of running on both emulator and real devices.

## ðŸ”¹ 5. CI/CD Integration

- Configured GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on every push.
- Sample `test.yml` file runs Selenium test cases in headless mode.

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Utilities

- Shell script (`dataCleanup.sh`) to reset the testing environment.
- Code comments and logging included for debugging and traceability.
